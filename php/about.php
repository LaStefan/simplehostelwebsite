<div class="content"><div><p class="pfont">Thanks to S&B Hostel, Bed and Breakfast Eindhoven,
            it is now possible to spend a cheap night in the center of Eindhoven.
            S&B is an atmospheric hostel with a friendly atmosphere.
            It is located in the middle of the bustling center of Eindhoven within walking
            distance of cafes, restaurants, parks and museums. There is something for everyone here.
            Our Hostel has everything that our guests need.
            After our years of experience as a backpacker at home and abroad, we know what to look out
            for in terms of comfort and service.This manifests itself in various practical services such
            as the possibility to wash your clothes. But also that extra socket in the sanitary room so that our guests can shave.
            Our living room with games, pool table, relaxed couches, and reading tables is a cozy place to
            stay after a day's walk through the city, or a tough journey. Under the heading of facilities you can
            find more about our fantastic price / quality ratio.We receive individual guests, and groups. You sleep
            in bunk beds in multi-person rooms.
            Take a look around our site to taste the atmosphere of our Hostel. And perhaps a room to book.<br></div>
